```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```{r}

x <- rnorm(n = 30, mean = 4, sd = 2.3)
x_again <- rnorm(n = 30, mean = 6, sd = .3)
y <- rnorm(n = 30, mean = 24, sd = 2.3)

(x - mean(x))/sd(x)
(x_again - mean(x_again))/sd(x_again)

# want to automate this.
```

Function:

```{r}

#called z score function, it is an object, the argument is something called x.

z_score <- function(x){
  
  (x - mean(x))/(sd(x))
  
}

```

Try out function:

```{r, error=TRUE}

z_score(x = x_again)

z_score(x = y)

z_score(x = 3)

z_score(x = "my name is Molly")

z_score(x = c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE))

z_score(x = iris)

#function as written requires as object you can compute the mean and sd.

```

update function:

```{r}

z_score <- function(x){
  
  if(!is.numeric(x)){
    stop("x should be numeric")
  } else if (length(x) < 3) {
    stop("x should be longer than 3")
  }
  
  (x - mean(x))/(sd(x))
  
}

```

# Multiple outputs:

```{r}

mean_and_sd <- function(x){
  
  if(!is.numeric(x)){
    stop("x should be numeric")
  } else if (length(x) < 3) {
    stop("x should be longer than 3")
  }
  
  tibble(
    mean_input = mean(x),
    sd = sd(x))

}

```

test:

```{r}

mean_and_sd(x = y)


```


```{r}

mean_and_sd <- function(x){
  
  if(!is.numeric(x)){
    stop("x should be numeric")
  } else if (length(x) < 3) {
    stop("x should be longer than 3")
  }
  
  list(
    mean_input = mean(x),
    sd = sd(x),
    z_score = (x - mean(x))/sd(x))

}


```

test:
